# Code Refactor Starter Code
This assignment focuses on rewriting someone else's fully functional code to be more streamlined.
Changing the tags from <div> to better semantic tags, particularly ones that are implied by the classes attached is the first part of this. This is followed by confirming that the tags flow in a sensible and orderly manner, particularly with the heading tags being properly sequential. The biggest functional change is adding a title to the website. While less visible to the abled, alts have been added to the images of the webpage.
In addition to these changes to the html, I have also tweaked the CSS by consolidating multiple strings of identical code in keeping with the philosophy of Don't Repeat Yourself. In some cases this includes removing many of the styles attached to class in favor of matching them to elements. I have opted to leave the classes in the html file as I believe they can be used for future changes but have removed the two ids that are identical to the classes attached to their respective sections as they had no representation in the initial stylesheet.
The site has now been deployed at https://yeshnels.github.io/JoshuaNelsonModule1Horiseon/ and appears to be fully functional.
